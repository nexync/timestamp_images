### Dated Data Review

These files show the ablation results where the number of documents in each month bucket are reduced. To be specific, rather than taking the 5000 most edited topics, we take the $x$ most edited topics across the collection period and calculate average mean of the median 95% relative perplexity values. We plot those averages for LLaMA, RedPajamas, and OLMo. Note that when $x=5000$, this is the same result as in the paper (Figure 4).
